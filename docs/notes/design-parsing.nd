# Nota/Coda parsing


## Coda Parsing

Code maps to a tree, and getting the structure of that tree typically depends
on:

- Explicit start and end delimiters pairs (`{`+ Ì€}`, `#`+`\n`) or single delimiters (`"`, `'`)
- Indentation of the current line (eg. Python)

The structure can be identified by marking start and end markers in a document
to as belonging to the same block

	a = "This is a string which is parsed as a block"
	    ^ Start of block 0                          ^ End of block 0

In addition to that, we want to mark some parts of the text as defining something

	a = "This is a string which is parsed as a block"
	^ Definition of symbol "a"

In absence of a formal grammar, the easiest way to parse all of that is to generate
a sequence of markers that can then be folded in to a tree.
